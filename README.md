# Pixapper
 A little program that takes in pixel art and outputs map and source files (in a png format).

# To Do
- Read png into an array of pixels with rgb data.
- Specify spritesheet columns and rows so that mapping accounts for this.
- Read one sprite and create a copy with colors that match a map.
